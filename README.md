## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this project is to use Python to automate certifying election results for a congressional precint in Colorado.  Certifying this election using this method means this same method may be used to certify other elections for congressional, senatorial and local elections.  In addition to providing the breakdown of the votes by candidate, we need to provide a breakdown by county.
